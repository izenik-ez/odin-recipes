        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This "pancake" lasagna is fast and easy to throw together. While you could just boil a couple of lasagna noodles, in just about the same amount of time, you can also make a crepe-like pancake using the exact same ingredients. In my opinion, this results in a superior final product. Once covered in sauce and cheese and beautifully browned in the oven, these pancakes look, feel, and taste like homemade sheets of pasta.
        </p>
        <p>You can even freeze the crepes for future use. Assuming you have a jar of sauce around and some cheese in the fridge, you'll be all set for future lasagna cravings. Of course, you can customize your layers with whatever you have around, with seasonal vegetables being an obvious choice. Go find yourself some appropriately sized heatproof baking dishes and give this fast, "fun-sized," free-style lasagna a try soon. Enjoy!

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 &#189; cups prepared marinara sauce</li>
            <li>1 cup grated Monterey Jack cheese</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon finely sliced fresh basil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Set out 4 small, shallow, oven-proof baking dishes or ramekins.</li>
            <li>Combine eggs, salt, olive oil, water, and flour for pancakes in a large bowl. Whisk thoroughly until very smooth, then let sit at room temperature for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Brush oil into a nonstick skillet and set heat to medium. When the skillet is hot, add about 1/4 cup batter and tilt the pan so it evenly coats the bottom. Cook until the batter sets and the top surface goes from looking wet to dry, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook the other side for 1 minute. Transfer to a plate and repeat to make remaining 3 pancakes. Cut each pancake into 3 triangles.</li>
            <li>Combine ricotta cheese, salt, pepper, cayenne, basil, and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese for filling in a bowl; mix with a fork until thoroughly combined.</li>
            <li>Prepare lasagnas: Spread 2 tablespoons marinara sauce into the bottom of each baking dish. Lay 1 pancake triangle on the sauce, then top with about 2 tablespoons ricotta filling, 1 tablespoon Monterey Jack cheese, and 2 teaspoons marinara. Repeat to create another layer, slightly pressing down on the second pancake triangle before topping with filling and cheese. Top with the remaining pancake triangle, pressing down slightly. Add remaining marinara and Monterey Jack, sprinkle with Parmigiano-Reggiano, and drizzle with olive oil.</li>
            <li>Place the baking dishes on a large sheet pan and bake in the center of the preheated oven until lightly browned and bubbly, about 15 minutes. Let cool for about 5 minutes, then garnish with basil and serve.</li>
        </ul>
